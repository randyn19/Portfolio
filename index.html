    <p class="intro">My name is Randy Navarrette, I am born and raised in Orange County, California 
        and enjoy many hobbies here which include, taking my dog to the beach, 
        going hiking, and riding my bike. I am Computer Sciences major at Concordia
        University in Irvine, CA. I am looking into pursuing a career in computer programming
        or software engeneering, I have always been passionate about computers, I enjoy the idea of creating
        something out of nothing, and I enjoy the flexibility this industry provides.
